## Chapter 5: Jumping around with `goto`

It's time for getting into some pretty important stuff when it comes to programming:
(conditional) jumps! With these jumps you can create complex programs with sub-processes
and the like - more about jump and it's use cases in this chapter!

### What is `goto`?

History time!<br>
The goto expression is a relic of the past - while many languages still support the use
of it, you almost never see it in modern code. It is an unconditional jump, meaning
it will jump to a given line-index or label in the code regardless of environment - 
unconditional meaning that it always executes whenever it is called, no exceptions.

As much as I bashed on goto now, it's still mandatory in YOLOL as it comes without
loops or the like - we'll have to write them ourselves!

### Finite and infinite loops

If you have some programming knowledge you probably came across `for` or `while` couple
of times. They are so called `loops`, as they repeat the block of instructions inside
of them a given amount of times. A small example:<br>

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(`Iteration: ${i}`);
}
```

For each iteration this code will print something to our console as long as `i` is smaller
than 10. Simple, right? In YOLOL we don't have this kind of syntax.

#### Infinite loops

In order to achieve a loop in YOLOL we'll have to use `goto`. 

>**Step #1:**<br>
>Copy the follwing code into your device and see what happens:
>```
>i = 0
>i += 1
>goto 2
>```

What this code will do is initializing a variable called `i` and increase it by one each
time the second line is executed. The goto will make the program jump back into line 2, 
thus the variable will be increased until an overflow-error forces the program to
terminate. And with this, we have our first infinite loop!<br><br>

But what if we want to increase `i` to a specific value - let's say 50?<br>
