## Chapter 3: Data fields in YOLOL

Last chapter we left off on creating our first device. However, we did not code a single line yet.<br>

>**Step #1:**<br>
>To get the magic started, click on the `Make scriptable`-Button.

Your window then should look like this:

First, let me explain on what you're seeing here.<br>
* The enumerated rows are the rows to write your code in.<br>**Remember:** Only 70 characters per line and one line executed per 0.2 seconds.<br>

Three new buttons in the top right have appeared aswell.<br>
* `Run` let's Yoloxide execute each line
* `Pause` will pause the execution of your code
* `Step` will, if your code is paused, execute the next line in your code

### Accessing data fields
Let's say we want to change the current state from our door from closed to open. For that, we'd have to change the data field we titled `openState` from `false` to `true` (or any other value). So let's try the following:

>**Step #2:**<br>
>Write `openState = "true"` into the first line and click on run.<br>
>What this expression does is assigning a variable called `openState` the value `"true"`.

Upon running the code and pausing it right after a new local variable is added. However our original goal to change the `openState` data field of our device was not achieved, as seen in the picture:

##### Why..?
What happens here is that we didn't address a data field at all. Instead we created a local variable. To address a data field we need to add a colon (`:`) in front of the name of the field, like this: <br>
`:openState`<br>
Let's change this in our code! In order to be able to change the code we'll have to stop it from being executed.

>**Step #3:**<br>
>Click the `Stop`-button in the top left and change `openState` to `:openState` in your code.

Upon rerunning the code it should now change the `openState` of our door-device to the value you assigned it to.<br>
**We opened our door!!**

#### Difference between local variables and device specific data fields
Just like data fields, local variables are able to hold any kind of value, as long as they are either a String or a number. However, they do not directly affect the device like data fields. Variables are rather for temporarily saving data to use in calculations or the like. We might not need them for simple code like the one we just wrote but we'll definitely need them in later chapters.
