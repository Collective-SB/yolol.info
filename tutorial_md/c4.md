## Chapter 4: Hello World!

In the previous chapter we used so called **Strings** to check if the door we created was closed or locked.<br>
Why not a simple boolean I hear some folks asking? Simple: The only available data types in YOLOL are 
**numbers** (Integers and Decimals) and **Strings** (a list of characters).<br>
So in reality using `false` and `true` means nothing other than you assigning a String to a field, 
**not** a boolean. Realistically, the devices in game will use a number, 1 meaning true and 0 meaning false. These will be accessed and modified in the exact same way, but strings were used previously for readability.

>**Step #1:**<br>
>To get stuff started, write `var = "Hello!"` into the first line and see what happens!

As you will see, a local variable called `var` will be initialised with the value `Hello!`.
Now let's try and add another word to the String using **String operations**.<br>
String operations will manipulate an existing String to add or remove parts to/ from it.
More about operators and their usage in the [official documentation](https://wiki.starbasegame.com/index.php/YOLOL#Basic_arithmetic_and_assignment_operators)!

>**Step #2:**<br>
>Write `var += "World!"` into the second line.<br>
>*This will add the word `World` to the end of the String assigned to `var`.*

Your window should then look like this:

As you may have noticed, the resulting String has an excess questionmark in between the two words. Why?

The operator `+=` appends or adds something to the specified variable. It does not replace or remove characters, thus the questionmark after `Hello` remains. 
An easy fix would obviously be to change `var` to just `Hello`, but that would be boring! Here we can use another operator: `--`

>**Step #3:**<br>
>Write `var--` in between the two lines you already wrote down.

As you see, there's still a space missing inbetween the words. I'll leave that one for you to figure out though ;)
