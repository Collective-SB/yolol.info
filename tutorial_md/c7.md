## Chapter 7: Manipulating Strings

<<<<<<< HEAD
Understanding Strings and how they can be manipulated in YOLOL might become one of the most important skills for anyone interested in building more complex structures with it.
Reversing and reducing Strings aswell as getting single characters from them are the topics of this chapter!

### Reducing Strings
Just like you can reduce a number with the `--` operator, you can also reduce a String's length.
Say we have a field titled `input` which holds the value `"Hello World!"`.
If we then reduce our input with `--` it will then hold `"Hello World"` - the exclamation mark has been removed!

Alternatively to get rid of a specific character or part of your String you can also simply use `-=` while providing one or more characters you would like to have removed. Example:
```
input = "Hello World!"
input --	// Input now holds "Hello World"
input -= "Hello "	// Input now holds "World"
```

### Counting by reducing
To get the length of a String we simply need to count the amount of times we need to reduce it by one character. The easiest way of realizing this would be to loop over the given String and applying the `--` operator while increasing a new field which will act as our counter. So, let's implement exactly that!

```
:input = "Hello" :counter = 0
if :input != "" then :input -- counter ++ goto 2 else goto 3 end
goto 3
```

The above code checks whether the given String is empty or not - if it isn't it reduces it by one character and increases our counter by one.

> This code will **not** work in Yoloxide! Yoloxide apparently uses an outdated interpreter which can't reduce a single-character String to an empty one - thus counting up infinitely.
> To try this code out check out CYLON's Discord and use the YOLOL-bot Toaster there!

And boom! We have our first String-counter, for whatever we could need it for!
Though: There are quicker variants of achieving this result by abusing the power of errors! More on that in the next chapter!


### Reversing and getting characters of a String

```
input = "AAAAA Helo" i=input
if input != "" then a = i---i goto 2 end
```
