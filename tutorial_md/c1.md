## Chapter 1: What is Starbase?

Frozenbyte, a video game company based in Finland announced a new game by the name of [Starbase](https://www.frozenbyte.com/games/starbase/) at the end of May, 2019.
Together with the announcement an [announcement trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXLTFwoYM_s) was released, which shows off some main features the game will come with. To this day they regularly post spotlight videos to their [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXLTFwoYM_s&list=PLh-M5-wAw6pmWgu83-8ujEIQnxl5ooz7G) of Starbase videos.
To the surprise of the CEO of Frozenbyte the game rapidly gained in following and soon had a thriving community creating fan-made content such as lore or blender-models of spaceships.

### Random numbers and facts!
- Frozenbyte announced that they would like to see the game release into early access this year, after a successful closed alpha.
- The idea of Starbase originates from past game designs of Frozenbyte's CEO which didn't make it into development. This one did though, and we're all **very** happy about that!
- Around 60 of Frozenbyte's approx. 100 employees are working on Starbase every day! This number fluctuates though as development-stages change.<br>

### ..And what is YOLOL?

YOLOL is the ingame scripting language you'll use to add code to your ship to make things work the way they're supposed to. If it's doors, cannons or engines - they all have to be controlled in some way, and that way is YOLOL-code stored and executed on dedicated YOLOL-chips. And that's what this tutorial will try to teach you!
> **Fun Fact:**<br> YOLOL shows close similarities to [GW-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC), which is a dialect of BASIC (a programming language by Microsoft).

To make creating larger ships or factories more complex there are certain limitations implemented into YOLOL.<br>
You are, for example, only able to write 70 characters per line of code and only 20 lines of code on one YOLOL-chip. Also, one line of YOLOL takes 0.2 seconds to be executed which pushes us into the direction of optimizing code - but that's for a later chapter.<br>
For now, why not start with the very basics?
