## Chapter 2: Using Yoloxide

Like mentioned in the last chaper, the evergrowing community of Starbase has sat together and created their own interpreter for the currently known [YOLOL-syntax](https://wiki.starbasegame.com/index.php/YOLOL). It has it's roots in [CYLON](https://discord.gg/rmu6aCr), a non-faction with over 1000 members actively discussing YOLOL and other programming related topics. Make sure to give them a visit if you have any questions that might come up throughout reading this tutorial!

### Setting up a scriptable device

Like in Starbase itself you also need a device to control via YOLOL in Yoloxide.<br>

>**Step #1:**<br>
>Visit [yoloxide.cylon.xyz/networks](https://yoloxide.cylon.xyz/networks) and click on `Add new device`.

Your page should then look like the following:

You can rename your device by clicking on the `new device` field in the top left.<br>
For this chapter let's create a device that's modeled after a door that you might find ingame.
>**Step #2:**<br>
>Rename the `new device` to `door`.

In Starbase, you can manipulate devices by changing their **data fields**. Data fields might be `openState` which tells us whether the door is closed or not or `lockedState` which determines if the door is locked.<br>

>**Step #3:**<br>
>Enter `openState` into `Field's name` and `false` in `Start value`. Afterwards click `Create` and repeat the process for `lockedState` (also click `create` again).

Afterwards, your device should look like this:
